# 🦀 Rustlings


Rustlings is a hands-on collection of small exercises designed to help you learn the Rust programming language. Each exercise focuses on a specific Rust concept, such as variables, functions, control flow, primitive types, ownership, borrowing, structs, enums, strings, modules, collections, error handling, generics, traits, lifetimes, and more.


## 📁 Project Structure


- **📚 exercises/**: Contains all the Rust exercises, organized by topic. Each subfolder covers a different Rust concept and includes both the exercise files (`*.rs`) and a `README.md` with instructions.
- **📝 solutions/**: Contains reference solutions for each exercise, organized in the same structure as the `exercises/` folder.
- **🛠️ Cargo.toml**: The manifest file for Rust projects, used for dependency management.
- **🔧 rust-analyzer.toml**: Configuration for the Rust Analyzer extension.


## 🚀 How to Use


1. **📥 Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rustlings
   ```
2. **🖥️ Open the project in your favorite editor (e.g., VS Code).**
3. **🔰 Start with the first exercise:**
   - Navigate to `exercises/00_intro/` and read the `README.md`.
   - Open the corresponding `.rs` file and follow the instructions in the comments.
4. **✏️ Edit the code to complete the exercise.**
5. **✅ Check your solution:**
   - You can use `rustc` to compile individual files or use the provided scripts/tools if available.
   - Compare your solution with the reference in the `solutions/` folder if you get stuck.
6. **➡️ Proceed to the next exercise.**
